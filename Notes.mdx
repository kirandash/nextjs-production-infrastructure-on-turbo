### Create a monorepo with TurboRepo

- https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/monorepo-turborepo
- turbo is a lightweight monorepo tool and works very well with vercel
- `pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest`
  - dlx will download and execute and not install the package globally
- https://github.com/kirandash/nextjs-production-infrastructure-on-turbo

- To create a new app in the monorepo
  - `cd apps`
  - `pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest company-website --use-pnpm`
- Copy eslint.config.js from web app to company-website app so that we can use the eslint config from packages
- Copy dependencies from web app to company-website app
  - ex: "@repo/eslint-config"
- Copy tsconfig.json from web app to company-website app so that we can use the ts config from packages
- install the changes at root level: `pnpm i`

### use rimraf to delete node_modules

- `pnpm add rimraf -D`
  - to force: `pnpm add rimraf -D --workspace-root` or `pnpm add rimraf -D -w`
- add clean script in package.json
- `pnpm clean`

### Storybook in monorepo

- Question:

  - where to put storybook?
    - with the ui library?
    - with the app?
    - with the monorepo root that has all components from the monorepo which is the apps and the ui libraries?

- We will see all the options
- ui library i.e. packages/ui
  - `cd packages/ui`
  - `npx sb@latest init` or `pnpm dlx sb@latest init`
  - if you want to use your own docs then turn off `autodocs`
- app i.e. apps/company-website
  - `cd apps/company-website`
  - `npx sb@latest init` or `pnpm dlx sb@latest init`
  - add tailwind to storybook
    - `pnpm dlx storybook@latest add @storybook/addon-styling-webpack`
    - https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-styling-webpack
    - add import "../src/app/global.css"; to .storybook/preview.js
  - Storybook for Async RSC (Experimental)
    - https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-react-server-components/
    - TODO: Currently RSC is working but posts API in network is causing an infinite loop and breaking the page
- (My personal favorite) storybook for the monorepo root by creating a separate react application for storybook

  - `cd apps`
  - `pnpm create vite storybook --template react-ts`
    - we are using vite to create the react app because it is faster than CRA and ideal for creating storybook app
    - config ts
    - init storybook
      - `cd apps/storybook`
      - `pnpm dlx sb@latest init`

- Run all storybooks together using turborepo
  - change ports in package.json for storybook run scripts to 6007 and 6008 respectively
  - in turbo.json add a definition for a storybook task
  - go to the root of the monorepo and run a turbo task ie `pnpm turbo storybook`
    - this will all run all the storybook scripts in all package.json files
- Feel free to use a combination of the 3 above options and then use turbo to run all of them together

### How to Organize and name server, client components in monorepo

- Ex:
  - Posts List page: page.tsx
  - Posts List: PostList.server.tsx this will call the getPosts API and show the list of posts
    - RSC
  - Posts List Client: PostList.client.tsx
  - use index.ts in PostList folder to export both PostList.server.tsx and PostList.client.tsx
    - this will give you a clean import
    - also it will hide implementation details viz server first or client first
- Note: .client and .server are just naming conventions and not mandatory in next.js but in remix it is mandatory
