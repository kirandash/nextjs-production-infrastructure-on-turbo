### Create a monorepo with TurboRepo

- https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/monorepo-turborepo
- turbo is a lightweight monorepo tool and works very well with vercel
- `pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest`
  - dlx will download and execute and not install the package globally
- https://github.com/kirandash/nextjs-production-infrastructure-on-turbo

- To create a new app in the monorepo
  - `cd apps`
  - `pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest company-website --use-pnpm`
- Copy eslint.config.js from web app to company-website app so that we can use the eslint config from packages
- Copy dependencies from web app to company-website app
  - ex: "@repo/eslint-config"
- Copy tsconfig.json from web app to company-website app so that we can use the ts config from packages
- install the changes at root level: `pnpm i`
